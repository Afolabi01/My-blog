## The Afolabi
Well, this is a new way I refer to myself now, seems catchy and I think I am getting use to it.
Getting to the order of the day(article '-') , this is my safe place, where I share information, give my opinion and be myself. I am a Data analyst, UI/UX designer, Chemical engineering student, a musician, performer and song writer.

  This is a place to learn, read for fun, criticize my ideas , criticize others and all. Basically just be myself.
