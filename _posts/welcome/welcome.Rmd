# Oyemade Emmanuel
The question I ask at times is who am I , what do people think when my name is mentioned. Well, I do not have an answer to what people think about me but I do have one for who I want to be; an innovator, an helper , a person who is not scared to go beyond the limits and is ready to do more everyday. Having that in mind, I try to do more every single day, I try to learn more and try more every day. At the end of it all, I want my decisions to have impacted enough lives around the world to grow and help people through my actions.
I am a Chemical Engineering student that believes in constant growth. I have going through various training and courses and I have been able to acquire a number of skills,but my ability to Google search is my most priced skill as it helps me get through situations much easily. My ability to find what I need off the internet has helped me grow and keep growing.
I have also been able to get a bunch of resources on the internet which hopefully, I would be able to share someday.
I enjoy singing, researching, listening to podcast(Dataframed) and song writing in my free time, helps me keep my mind off a lot of things. I am taking up blogging as one of my leisure engagement.
